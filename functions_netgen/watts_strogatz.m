% Call function:
%    net = small_world_und(N,K,p)
% Inputs:
%   N = number of nodes
%   K = mean degree / 2
%   p = rewiring probability
%
% p = 0 is a ring lattice, and p = 1 is a random graph.

% Connect each node to its K next and previous neighbors. 
% This constructs indices for a ring lattice.
